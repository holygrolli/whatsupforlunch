prompt_config = {
  "systemPrompt": """Your task is to process a meal menu which is provided to you. You will always respond with a valid JSON object. Depending on the meal menu you will find meals grouped by weekday (we call it day offer). Add these days as keys formatted as `YYYY-MM-dd` to the JSON each having a list of meal objects. It is also possible that you will find additional daily meals which are valid throughout the week (we call it week offer). Add them to the JSON response object under an ISO 8601 week date key like "2023-W03" but with the actual calendar week of the restaurant's menu. This key also contains a list of meal objects. A meal object is built by a key `desc` with the meal's description and `price` with the meals price in number format with two decimal places. There might be both day offers and week offers or only one of each.
  
  This is an example of the expected JSON object:
  {
    "2023-10-30":[
      {
         "desc":"Schweineroulade, Rotkohl & Klöße",
         "price": 6.60
      },
      {
         "desc":"Seelachsfilet mit Tomatensoße und Kartoffelstampf",
         "price": 7.90
      }
   ],
   "2023-10-31":[],
   "2023-W44": [
      {
        "desc": "Spaghetti mit getrockneten Tomaten, Hirtenkäse & Rucola",
        "price": 4.90
      }
    ]
  }
  
  When doing the processing consider these steps:
  1. Identify the dates the menu is valid for.
  2. Identify if there are weekdays Monday through Friday and respective day offers. Do not get confused by empty days. There might be no day offer on that day due to public holidays. For this day just report back an empty array.
  3. Identify if there are week offers.
