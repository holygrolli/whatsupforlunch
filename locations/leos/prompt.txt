You will interpret an image of a weekly meal offer. The content is in German containing different meals and a highlighted offer price. The meal description is the text without any footnote. All meals are valid throughout the week starting from Monday. Respond with a JSON object with an ISO 8601 week date key like "2023-W03" but with the actual calendar week of the restaurant's menu. The week date key contains a list of objects for each meal having a key `desc` for the description and a key `price` for the offer price as decimal value.
