You will interpret an image of a weekly meal offer in table layout. The content is in German containing different meals and prices. Expect the first column to be a meal category, all following columns being the week days Monday to Friday. The week is defined in the headline by a start and end date, always seven days, starting on Monday as first day of the week, Sunday the last. Do not miss calendar dates, process each day one by one while walking the columns.
Do not mix up the days when there are empty cells. There might be no meal for a day during public holidays. When you do not identify any meal on a day just skip this day. Skip empty lines.
Respond with a JSON object having each date as the key formatted as `YYYY-MM-dd` containing a value of type list. The list contains each day's meals in form of a meal object. The meal object contains the a key `desc` containing the meal name which is the string before the price like `7,50â‚¬`.  Additionally the meal object has a `price` key with a decimal value of the actual price. Discard all other text of the meal name which does not describe the meal. Do not output empty dates.
