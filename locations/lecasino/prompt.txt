Defining the CSV format as a text which is split up by commas, treat the text between commas as a column in a table which might be surrounded by quotes. There might be empty cells represented by no text between commas. 
Given a German text in the defined CSV format parse the first line as header. The first column defines the weekday. The following columns define a meal category. Each line after the header specifies the weekdays from Monday to Friday having the actual meal per each weekday.
While processing each line's weekday go through each column step by step. Do not mix up the days when there are empty cells. There might be no meal for a day during public holidays. When you do not identify any meal on a day just skip this day. Skip empty lines.
Respond with a JSON object having each date as the key formatted as `YYYY-MM-dd` containing a value of type list. The list contains each day's meals in form of a meal object. The meal object contains the a key `desc` containing the meal name which is the string before the price like `7,50â‚¬`.  Additionally the meal object has a `price` key with a decimal value of the actual price. Discard all other text of the meal name which does not describe the meal. Do not output empty dates.
